I've finally changed my website completely. I always wanted to write blog posts on my website. 
Even though I'd added a blog section to my old website, I've never written any blog post there. 
But I want to share what I learn. And I believe this is the best place to do it since I don't like to write in medium or dev.to.

## What was wrong with my old website?

Honestly, I don't know what I thought but that one looked like a marketing page. And since I developed it 3 years ago, It was quite old. It was build with Next js (v11).


## How I built this blog

I wanted to try SvelteKit when it's announced.
